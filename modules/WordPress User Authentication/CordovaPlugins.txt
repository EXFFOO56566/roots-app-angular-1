Instructions
////////////

In the WordPress Plugins directory there are 2 plugins for the JSON API, if you want to protect your content and only show it to registered users you must use the json-api-auth.zip and also the json-api-user.zip you will find more information in how to set up these plugins. 




Access Origin
/////////////

In order to cache remote images via http it is important to allow access to those domains. This can be setup via a whitelisting <access> element in your config.xml file.

If you only want to do tests you can allow access to all domains to avoid this kind of issues:

<access origin="*" />
In order to avoid possible security issues, always limit the allowed domains list whenever possible.
