Access Origin
/////////////

In order to stream the radio it is important to allow access to that domain. This can be setup via a whitelisting <access> element in your config.xml file.

If you only want to do tests you can allow access to all domains to avoid this kind of issues:

<access origin="*" />
In order to avoid possible security issues, always limit the allowed domains list whenever possible.
